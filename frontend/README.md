* Firebase Project (for Google Authentication)
* Email Service Account (like Gmail with App Password, or a transactional email service like SendGrid/Mailgun for Nodemailer)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.examples` into `.env`.
    * Fill in your specific credentials for:
        * `PORT` (e.g., 3000)
        * `DB_URL` (your MongoDB connection string)
        * Cloudinary credentials (`CLOUDINARY_...`)
        * `JWT_SECRET` (a strong, random secret key)
        * Nodemailer credentials (`EMAIL_...`)
        * Firebase Admin SDK credentials (can be obtained from your Firebase project settings - **Important:** Format the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` correctly, often needs `\n` preserved)
        * `FRONTEND_URL` (URL where your frontend will run, e.g., `http://localhost:5173`)

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.examples` into `.env`.
    * Fill in your specific credentials for:
        * `VITE_BACKEND_URL` (URL where your backend is running, e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`)
        * Firebase Client SDK credentials (`VITE_APIKEY`, `VITE_AUTHDOMAIN`, etc. - obtained from your Firebase project web app settings)

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev  # For development with nodemon
    # or
    # npm start    # For production
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or your configured frontend port).
